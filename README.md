## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-based multilingual mobile application and chatbot that provides personalized crop advisory services tailored to farmers’ needs. The platform will integrate data from soil tests, weather forecasts, and crop history to generate actionable insights. Farmers can upload images for instant pest and disease detection using computer vision technology, while weather-linked alerts and fertilizer recommendations ensure timely decisions. Market price tracking increases their bargaining power, and voice-based interactions bridge the gap for low-literate users. The uniqueness of this solution lies in its regional language support, offline usability in low-connectivity areas, and integration of multiple features into one trusted digital assistant for farmers.

## Technical Approach
Technologies Used:

AI/ML for crop advisory and predictive analytics

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multilingual and voice-based interactions

Computer vision models for pest/disease detection via image uploads

Mobile application framework with offline sync support

Cloud-based infrastructure for scalable data storage and processing

APIs for integration with weather forecasting services and market price databases

Methodology and Implementation:

Data Collection: Gather soil, crop, and weather data from farmers and government sources

Advisory Engine (AI Model): Analyze soil profile, crop choice, and local weather to generate recommendations

Farmer Interaction: Farmers access advice via mobile app/chatbot using text, image, or voice input in local languages

Alerts & Notifications: Continuous updates on weather, pest risks, and fertilizer schedules

Feedback Loop: Farmer responses logged to improve model accuracy over time.

## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is highly feasible given current smartphone penetration in rural India and government support for digital agriculture. Pilot testing in selected districts of Punjab can demonstrate adoption. Potential challenges include digital literacy, trust in technology, and affordability. These can be addressed through:

Simple app design with voice-first interaction

Partnerships with cooperatives, NGOs, and extension workers for farmer training

Government subsidies or public-private partnerships for large-scale deployment

The solution is viable in the long term because it reduces costs, improves yield, and contributes to environmental sustainability while aligning with national agricultural digitization policies.

## Impact and Benefits
Economic Impact: Improved crop yield (20–30%), reduced input costs, better access to fair market prices

Social Impact: Empowerment of smallholder farmers, reduced reliance on middlemen, better income stability

Environmental Impact: Reduced overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, improved soil health, and sustainable practices

Policy Alignment: Supports initiatives like Digital India, PM-Kisan, and state-level smart farming policies
