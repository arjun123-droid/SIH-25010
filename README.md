## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI-based multilingual mobile application and chatbot that provides personalized crop advisory services tailored to farmers’ needs. The platform will integrate data from soil tests, weather forecasts, and crop history to generate actionable insights. Farmers can upload images for instant pest and disease detection using computer vision technology, while weather-linked alerts and fertilizer recommendations ensure timely decisions. Market price tracking increases their bargaining power, and voice-based interactions bridge the gap for low-literate users. The uniqueness of this solution lies in its regional language support, offline usability in low-connectivity areas, and integration of multiple features into one trusted digital assistant for farmers.

## Technical Approach
Technologies Used:

AI/ML for crop advisory and predictive analytics

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multilingual and voice-based interactions

Computer vision models for pest/disease detection via image uploads

Mobile application framework with offline sync support

Cloud-based infrastructure for scalable data storage and processing

APIs for integration with weather forecasting services and market price databases

Methodology and Implementation:

Data Collection: Gather soil, crop, and weather data from farmers and government sources

Advisory Engine (AI Model): Analyze soil profile, crop choice, and local weather to generate recommendations

Farmer Interaction: Farmers access advice via mobile app/chatbot using text, image, or voice input in local languages

Alerts & Notifications: Continuous updates on weather, pest risks, and fertilizer schedules

Feedback Loop: Farmer responses logged to improve model accuracy over time

## Feasibility and Viability
Possibility:

India’s agriculture ecosystem, heavily composed of small and marginal farmers, urgently needs digital interventions to boost productivity and income. AI and digital advisory tools are uniquely positioned to fill this gap by providing localized, real-time, and actionable insights on soil health, weather, pest management, and market prices.

Ongoing projects like ICRISAT’s AI-powered Climate Advisory and AI-based platforms (such as iSAT) demonstrate successful implementation of scalable and regionally adaptable AI-driven advisory systems reaching thousands of smallholder farmers.

Government initiatives, including the Digital Agriculture Mission and AgriStack framework, reinforce the possibility by focusing on technology adoption, data integration, and farmer-centric digital services.

Feasibility:

AI technologies for crop advisory, pest/disease detection, and NLP-based multilingual and voice interfaces are mature and increasingly affordable. Low-cost smartphones and expanding digital coverage enhance access even in rural, low-connectivity areas.

Research and pilot studies highlight the effectiveness of these AI tools in improving crop yields by 20-30% and enabling better market access, translating into tangible income improvement for farmers.

Offline capabilities and regional language support address usability challenges for low-literate or digitally inexperienced users.

Collaborations among government organizations, agri-research institutes, tech companies, and NGOs provide the necessary ecosystem for implementation, support, and scaling.
## Impact and Benefits
Boosts crop yields by 20-30% through precise, data-driven recommendations on planting, fertilizer use, and pest control.

Enhances climate resilience with hyperlocal weather forecasts and early pest/disease detection, reducing crop losses.

Improves resource efficiency, lowering fertilizer and pesticide use and conserving water via smart irrigation advice.

Increases farmer incomes by enabling better market access and price tracking, reducing middlemen exploitation.

Bridges digital literacy gaps with voice-based, multilingual interactions and offline usability for remote or low-connectivity areas.

Supports scalable, sustainable agricultural transformation by integrating AI with government schemes and local knowledge.
